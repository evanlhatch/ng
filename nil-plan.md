PERFECT! All tests are passing, and the compiler warnings are gone!**

The `create_file` operation correctly structured `ng/src/nixos_test.rs`, and all 85 tests pass without any warnings from the compiler about unnameable items or dead code. The diagnostic output from `test_os_boot_dry_run` also confirms it's working as expected:
`Recorded commands for os boot --dry: ["nix build .#someHostForBoot --no-link --out-link /tmp/.tmpgo4STu/result"]`

This is a fantastic outcome. We've successfully:
*   Fixed the core command recording logic for dry runs.
*   Added new workflow tests (`os build`, `os boot`).
*   Resolved various compilation errors and warnings along the way.
*   Corrected issues in the `check_git.rs` module.
*   Ensured the test file structure is sound.

**Next Steps:**

We are in a very good position. I recommend the following:

1.  **Continue Expanding Workflow Test Coverage:**
    *   **`nh home switch` and `nh home build`**: These are the next logical subcommands to create tests for. They will likely require a `home_manager_test.rs` file or similar, and understanding of the `HomeManagerStrategy`.
    *   **Error conditions**: Test how workflows behave when underlying Nix commands (mocked via `test_support`) return errors.
    *   **`--extra-build-args`**: Verify these are correctly passed through to the `nix build` command.
    *   **`--no-out-link` for `os build`**: Test this specific flag for `os build`.

2.  **Review and Refine `clap` Interface (`interface.rs`):**
    *   Now that the core functionality is stable and well-tested, take a pass at the `clap` definitions.
    *   Focus on:
        *   **Consistency of `CommonArgs` access:** Can the path to flags like `dry`, `ask`, `no_nom` be made more uniform across subcommands? For example, if all specific arg structs (like `OsRebuildArgs`, `OsBuildArgs`, `OsBootArgs`, `HomeRebuildArgs`) directly flatten `CommonArgs` (e.g., `common: CommonArgs`), it would simplify access.
        *   **Clarity of flag definitions:** Ensure help messages are clear, and boolean flags correctly use `default_value_t` and `action` attributes (like we did for `--no-ask`).

3.  **Code Cleanup (Minor):**
    *   Remove any temporary diagnostic `eprintln!` statements if they are no longer needed (though the ones in `test_support::enable_test_mode` and `disable_test_mode` are proving useful for test debugging).
    *   Address any new minor warnings if they appear.

4.  **Consider Pre-flight Check Testability:**
    *   The `pre_flight.rs` module has checks. If these become more complex, think about how they can be tested, possibly by mocking their dependencies or the outcomes of checks.

I suggest we start with **testing `nh home switch --dry --clean`**. This will involve similar principles to the `os` subcommand tests but will exercise the `HomeManagerStrategy`.

Are you ready to create a new test file (e.g., `ng/src/home_manager_test.rs`) and write the first test for `home switch`?
