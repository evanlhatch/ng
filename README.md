## What does it do?

[nix-output-monitor]: https://github.com/maralorn/nix-output-monitor
[nvd]: https://khumba.net/projects/nvd

Nh is a modern helper utility that is a take at reimplementing some commands
from the NixOS ecosystem. We aim to provide more features and better ergonomics
than the existing commands.

We provide several subcommands, such as:

- `os`, which reimplements `nixos-rebuild`, with a tree of builds, diff and
  confirmation.
- `home`, which reimplements `home-manager`.
- `darwin`, which reimplements `darwin-rebuild`
- `search`, a super-fast package searching tool (powered by a ElasticSearch
  client).
- `clean`, my own take at cleaning GC roots from a NixOS system.

This wouldn't be possible without the programs that nh runs under the hood:

- Tree of builds with [nix-output-monitor].
- Visualization of the upgrade diff with [nvd].
- And of course, all the [crates](./Cargo.toml) we depend on.

## Installation

The latest, tagged version will is available in Nixpkgs as Nh stable. This
repository provides the latest development version of Nh, which you can get from
the flake outputs.

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#nh # stable
nix shell github:viperML/nh # dev
```

### NixOS

We provide a NixOS module that integrates `nh clean` as a service. To enable it,
set the following configuration:

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  programs.nh = {
    enable = true;
    clean.enable = true;
    clean.extraArgs = "--keep-since 4d --keep 3";
    flake = "/home/user/my-nixos-config";
  };
}
```

Nh supports both Flakes and classical NixOS configurations:

- For flakes, the command is `nh os switch /path/to/flake`
- For a classical configuration:
  - `nh os switch -f '<nixpkgs/nixos>'`, or
  - `nh os switch -f '<nixpkgs/nixos>' -- -I
  nixos-config=/path/to/configuration.nix`
    if using a different location than the default.

You might want to check `nh os --help` for other values and the defaults from
environment variables.

### Enhanced Features

Nh includes several enhanced features to improve the user experience:

#### Pre-flight Checks

Before building and activating configurations, nh performs several pre-flight checks:

- **Git Status Check**: Warns about untracked .nix files that might not be included in the build
- **Parse Check**: Validates syntax of .nix files to catch errors early
- **Lint Check**: Runs formatters and linters on .nix files (when available)

#### Build Modes

Nh supports different build modes with increasing levels of validation:

- **Quick Mode** (default): Basic checks only
- **Medium Mode** (`--medium`): Adds evaluation check
- **Full Mode** (`--full`): Adds dry-run build

#### Improved Error Reporting

Nh provides detailed error reports with:

- Clear error messages with context
- Syntax error highlighting
- Actionable recommendations
- Build logs for failed derivations

#### Progress Indicators

Nh shows progress for long-running operations:

- Spinners for active processes
- Clear success/failure indicators
- Structured output for complex data

#### Verbosity Levels

Control the amount of output with multiple verbosity levels:

- Default: Essential information only
- `-v`: Adds debug information
- `-vv`: Adds trace information

#### Specialisations support

Nh is capable of detecting which specialisation you are running, so it runs the
proper activation script. To do so, you need to give Nh some information of the
spec that is currently running by writing its name to `/etc/specialisation`. The
config would look like this:

```nix
{config, pkgs, ...}: {
  specialisation."foo".configuration = {
    environment.etc."specialisation".text = "foo";
    # ..rest of config
  };

  specialisation."bar".configuration = {
    environment.etc."specialisation".text = "bar";
    # ..rest of config
  };
}
```

#### Home-Manager

Home specialisations are read from `~/.local/share/home-manager/specialisation`.
The config would look like this:

```nix
{config, pkgs, ...}: {
  specialisation."foo".configuration = {
    xdg.dataFile."home-manager/specialisation".text = "foo";
    # ..rest of config
  };

  specialisation."bar".configuration = {
    xdg.dataFile."home-manager/specialisation".text = "bar";
    # ..rest of config
  };
}
```
